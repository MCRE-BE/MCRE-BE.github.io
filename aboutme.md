## 📝 My career

I started in 2013 at Delhaize Belgium (now part of Ahold Delhaize) as a management trainee. I spent 10 years within the company moving through different roles in the Supply Chain and Logistics organization. From pure operational roles, to tactical and strategic projects, I realized more and more than my main added value was in data crunching. I liked working with data and spending hours building and finetuning reports or models.

With the emergence of PowerBI and the Microsoft Power Platform, I was one of the first users to have access to a Premium PowerBI workspace moving swiftly to build a logistics reporting hub. From buidling simple operational reports, to estabilishing automation pipelines, I did it all.

The mariage was perfect with the ability to learn to work with Python during COVID. The use of the programming language was a perfect addition to the ETL pipelines that were needed to feed the reports requested by the business and automate as much as possible the workflow. The automation and aggregations allowed us to build a local data pool, accessible by all our stakeholders. The centralization and ease of access, saved our users countless hours and the power bi reports allowed to access years of data in a one-click solution. 

The availability of this datapool was the perfect starting ground to enhance our forecasting abilities. The role I filled move to the new S&OP organization and the project was started to enhance/improve/tailor our forecasts to the needed granularity. Be it Inbound, Outbound, Stock for short or long-term horizons, we did it all.

Key elements I would highlight : 
- I always worked from a business perspective : how can we get quick value out of a report? What can we do without big budgets or IT involvment?
- Agile is the word : spend some time to build a flexible base-layer and sematic model. Business change, users learn, ... You have to account for the fact that they will ask for changes.
- Work is sometimes good enough : all data is durty or has issues. Having a 100% correct report is needed for financial or regulatory compliance, but in most business settings, 95 to 99% accuracy is more than enough. Accepting this lower treshold saves time and money !
